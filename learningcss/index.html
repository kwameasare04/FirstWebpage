                <p>Whose mist is that? I think I know.
                    Its owner is quite happy though.
                    Full of joy like a vivid rainbow,
                    I watch him laugh. I cry hello.
                    
                    He gives his mist a shake,
                    And laughs until her belly aches.
                    The only other sound's the break,
                    Of distant waves and birds awake.
                    
                    The mist is heavy, calm and deep,
                    But he has promises to keep,
                    After cake and lots of sleep.
                    Sweet dreams come to him cheap.
                    
                    He rises from his gentle bed,
                    With thoughts of kittens in his head,
                    He eats his jam with lots of bread.
                    Ready for the day ahead.

        <div class="content-areaTwo"> <p> You are the sun that shines brightly throughout my day.
            You are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
            You are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
            You are stars that glimmer oh so bright.
            
            You are the oxygen that keeps me alive.
            You are my heart that beats inside.
            You are the blood that flows through me.
            You are the only guy I can see.
            You have the voice of when a mockingbird sings.
            You are my everything.
            
            You are my one and only.
            You stop me from being so lonely.
            We plan our future as if we have a clue.
            I never want to lose you.
            I want you to be my husband, and I want to be your wife.
            I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
